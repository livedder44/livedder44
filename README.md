## My Experience 🛠️

Currently, my main experience is related to developing and maintaining a website on the **Shopify** platform. Within this project, I have worked with:

- Setting up and customizing Shopify themes using **Liquid**, **HTML**, and **CSS**.
- Making changes to the structure and styles to improve the appearance and functionality.
- Understanding the principles of working with data in **JSON** format for configuring Shopify settings.
- Using **JavaScript** for adding interactive elements and custom functionality to the Shopify site.

Although this is my first major project, I am actively learning **JavaScript** and the **React** library to expand my skills and create more complex and interactive web applications.
